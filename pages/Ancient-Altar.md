The Ancient Altar is a block in the [Magical Gadgets](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Gadgets) category, as well as a Multiblock structure.<br>
It is used to craft other [magical items](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Items) and gadgets, and to [repair](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Repaired-Spawner) [Broken Spawners](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Broken-Spawner).

## Obtaining
The Ancient Altar block can be crafted in a [Magic Workbench](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Magic-Workbench).

## Usage
The Ancient Altar block on its own has no use. In order to have a working altar, the Ancient Altar must be surrounded by 8 [Ancient Pedestals](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ancient-Pedestal), 2 blocks away from it in cardinal directions and 1 block away diagonally.

A working Ancient Altar looks like this:

To begin the crafting process or "ritual", each ingredient in the recipe must be placed on the pedestals by right-clicking them.<br>
The item in the middle of the recipe (or "catalyst") must then be used on the central altar block.

It does not matter on which axis (diagonal or horizontal/vertical) the ingredients are placed, as long as they are in the right order.

If the recipe is correct, the catalyst will be consumed. Then, after a short animation, the Ancient Altar will expel the new item.
