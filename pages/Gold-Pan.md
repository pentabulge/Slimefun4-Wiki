The Gold Pan is a very important item that is part of the [Tools](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Tools) category.
There are two variants, the normal Gold Pan and the [Nether Gold Pan](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Nether-Gold-Pan).<br>
This page will only cover the standard Gold Pan.

## How to use the Gold Pan
You right-click a block of gravel while holding a Gold Pan in your main hand.<br>
The block will break and drop Flint, Clay, [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore) or an Iron Nugget.

You can read more about [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore) and how to use it in Slimefun's ["Getting Started" Guide](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Drop chances
Each item you can get with a Gold Pan has a different probability to drop, listed below.

| Item | Chance |
| ---- | ------ |
| Flint | 40% |
| [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore) | 35% |
| Clay | 20% |
| Iron Nugget | 5% |
