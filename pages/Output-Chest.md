An Output Chest is a [Basic Machine](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Basic-Machines) in Slimefun.

It is a chest which, when placed adjacent to the Dispenser part of a Basic Machine, collects any items crafted with it.<br>
It can also be placed next to the Stonecutter in a [Table Saw](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Table-Saw), or the Cauldron in an [Automated Panning Machine](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Automated-Panning-Machine).
