## Usage
Dusts can be smelted into [alloys](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ingots#Alloys) or their respective [ingots](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ingots#Metals) in a [Smeltery](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Smeltery).<br>
They can also be smelted in an [Electric Ingot Factory](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ingot-Factory) (for ingots) or an [Electric Smeltery](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Smeltery) (for alloys).
