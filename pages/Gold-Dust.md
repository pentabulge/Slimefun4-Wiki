Gold Dust is one of the nine [metal dusts](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining
Crushing Gold Ore in an [Ore Crusher](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ore-Crusher) or an [Electric Ore Grinder](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ore-Grinder) yields two pieces of Gold Dust.

Gold Dust also has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ore-Washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Dust-Washer).

## Usage
Gold Dust can be smelted into [4-Carat to 24-Carat Gold Ingots](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Gold-Ingot) in a [Smeltery](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ingot-Factory).<br>

It is also used in the [Corinthian Bronze Ingot](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Corinthian-Bronze-Ingot) [alloy](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ingots#Alloys).
