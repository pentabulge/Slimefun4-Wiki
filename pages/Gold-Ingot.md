Slimefun adds 11 new Gold Ingots to the game.<br>
They are differentiated by their purity (measured in "carats"), with the lowest purity being 4 and the highest being 24.

## Obtaining
Smelting [Gold Dust](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Gold-Dust) in a [Smeltery](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ingot-Factory) produces a 4-carat Gold Ingot.<br>
Higher purity gold is obtained by smelting any carat gold along with a piece of [Gold Dust](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Gold-Dust). This "adds" 2 carats, up until 24-carat gold.

## Usage
Slimefun Gold Ingots cannot substitute regular Gold Ingots in vanilla recipes. Instead, they are used in new recipes.
