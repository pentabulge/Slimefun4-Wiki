![Coal Generator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki/master/images/item-nuclear-reactor.png)

The Coal Generator is a type of [electricity](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) generator. There are currently two tiers of coal generators.

## Obtaining
All tiers of coal generators can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
A coal generator must be placed within 7 blocks of an [energy regulator](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Regulator) or a [capacitor](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Capacitors) in range of one (in a straight line; no diagonals), and provided with the appropriate fuel.<br>
Once it is placed, right-click it and place fuel in its inventory (two slots on the left).

## Tiers
The table below compares the two tiers of coal generators.

| Tier | Energy | Buffer |
| ---- | --- | ------ |
| I | 16 J/s | 64 J |
| II | 30 J/s | 256 J |

## Fuel
Despite being a "coal" generator, this generator can also be fueled with blaze rods, wood planks and logs.

| Fuel | Burning time | Total (Tier I) | Total (Tier II) |
| ---- | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Block of Coal | 1m 20s |  1.28 kJ | 2.4 kJ |
| Blaze Rod | 12s | 192 J |  360 J |
| Coal | 8s | 128 J | 240 J |
| Any Log | 2s | 32 J | 60 J |
| Any Planks | 1s | 16 J | 30 J |

Note that it is twice as efficient to turn your logs into planks before burning them as fuel. You can cut your logs in a [Table Saw](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Table-Saw) for even more planks.
