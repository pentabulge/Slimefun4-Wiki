Iron Dust is one of the nine [dusts](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining
Crushing Iron Ore in an [Ore Crusher](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ore-Crusher) or an [Electric Ore Grinder](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ore-Grinder) yields two pieces of Iron Dust, effectively doubling it.<br>
If you are using the [SlimefunOreChunks](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/SlimefunOreChunks) addon, you can use the same machines to turn Iron Ore Chunks from the [GEO Miner](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/GEO-Miner) into Iron Dust.

Iron Dust has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ore-Washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Dust-Washer).

Additionally, crushing an [Iron Ingot](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Iron-Ingot) in an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ingot-Pulverizer) produces one piece of Iron Dust.

## Usage
Iron Dust can be smelted into [Iron Ingots](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Iron-Ingot) in a [Smeltery](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ingot-Factory).

It is also used in the following [alloys](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ingots#Alloys) for the [Smeltery](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Smeltery) or the [Electric Smeltery](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Smeltery):
