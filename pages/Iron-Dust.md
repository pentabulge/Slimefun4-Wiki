Iron Dust is one of the nine [metal dusts](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining
Crushing Iron Ore in an [Ore Crusher](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ore-Crusher) or an [Electric Ore Grinder](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ore-Grinder) yields two pieces of Iron Dust, effectively doubling it.

Iron Dust also has a 11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ore-Washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Dust-Washer).

## Usage
Iron Dust can be smelted into [Iron Ingots](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Iron-Ingot) in a [Smeltery](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ingot-Factory).
